cfgundergroundtriggers.json - Tells the server where the underground lighting are activated and enabled.
mapgrouppos.xml - Tells the server where the new structures and objects are to spawn loot in.
mapgroupproto.xml - Standard Chera file telling what loot to spawn in buildings, but copied in the underground bunker and roadblock info from the Livonia file, seeing as Cherna doesn't normally have underground nor roadblock objects.
areaflags.map - Changed a bit, to increase the tier in the quary where the bunker is located at, as well as adding military and contaminated flags for the bunker, so most things things should spawn in there, including m4. Some Lunar loot also added to the cars and buildings outside for the lol of it.
custom -> ChernaBunker.json - Spawns in the many buildings and rocks used in the custom build.

Remember to enable cfggameplay and have copied in the bunker json files in the ArrSpawner: ""objectSpawnersArr": ["custom/ChernaBunker.json"]," 
I haven't added a way to get a punched card naturally, seeing as how you get the card, will definitely change the server you are on, so you will have to add a punched card through another json objecter spawner, event, or add it to loot in structures, tiers or zombies.

Good luck!
