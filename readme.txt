cfgundergroundtriggers.json - Tells the server where the underground lighting are activated and enabled.

mapgrouppos.xml - Tells the server where the new structures and objects are to spawn loot in.

mapgroupproto.xml - Standard Chera file telling what loot to spawn in buildings, but copied in the underground bunker and roadblock info from the Livonia file, seeing as Cherna doesn't normally have underground nor roadblock objects.

"custom" folde with ChernaBunker.json - Spawns in the many buildings and rocks used in the custom build.

areaflags.map file is too big for github, but you can download it from "https://ufile.io/vjhkmojc". It increases loot quality and tags in the bunker. Allowing it to spawn tier 4 stuff and items from contaminated areas. Not required, but loot might be a bit boring without it.


Remember to enable cfggameplay and have copied in the ChernaBunker.json file in the ArrSpawner: "custom/ChernaBunker.json"
I haven't added a way to get a punched card naturally, seeing as how you get the card, will definitely change the server you are on, so you might want to consider that. You'll have to add a punched card through another json objecter spawner, event, or add it to loot in structures, tiers or infected.

Good luck!
